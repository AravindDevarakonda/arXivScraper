# arXivScraper
Scraping meta-data form arXiv to quantify the change in publication rates over the past two decades.

This is a toy project that scrapes the arXiv pre-print server for publication meta-data using the Python BeautifulSoup package. The goal is to quantify how publication rates have changed across sub-fields of science as a function of time. Looking further into the future, this tool will be used to scrape abstracts from pre-prints and store them in a database for further processing.
